             Welcome to the RSIDE
            ----------------------

 CIDE is an integrated development environment for easy
 programming in C language.
 It can be use to write progams in C for different
 microcontrollers also for PC-Linux console programs 

 I hope CIDE provides an easy contact by first working 
 with microcontrollers. 
 
 CIDE is based on the IDE of Free Pascal: So, thousand 
 thanks goes to the developer of Free Pascal and the 
 Free Pascal IDE.
