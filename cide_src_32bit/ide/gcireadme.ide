             Welcome to the GCC IDE
            ------------------------

 The GCC IDE is heavily modified version of the
 Free Pascal IDE to do the job with a very small gcc-
 programming 

 I hope it provides an easy contact by first working with
 the GNU gcc compiler. Thousand thanks goes to the
 developer of Free Pascal and the Free Pascal IDE.
