Help files
------------------------------------------------------

Make a directory:

mkdir /usr/share/doc/cide

Copy all this files to this directory.

Opening and closing CIDE configs the help-path in your working directory. With the
next start of cide you can get the inline help from CIDE.

NOTE:
The help-files aren't by far not complete, but there are a lot of information
about microcontrollers and C-language implemented.

By example, you are not shure about the syntax for "strtoken" or how to write a
function by reference you will get information there
